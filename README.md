## Introductory Course on Model Order Reduction 

### Abstract: 

I will start my short course by introduce the class of Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems and the control related system theory for them. Although LTI can be used to model many real life processes, the mathematical theory for control is very general. The second lecture will be on the fundamental motivations and mathematical notions of model reduction in general and for LTI in particular. This lecture will provide some illustrative examples for the use and results of model reduction. In the third lecture, I will introduce the fundamental model reduction approach that uses projections and explain several ways to compute these projections. A mathematical well understood projection method is Balanced Truncation (BT). The 4th lecture will introduce BT and discuss how it can be applied in practice. The last lecture contains some example on how the LTI related theory can be extended to so called differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) or descriptor systems. After introducing some basic concepts, I will show and explain recent results concerning the control of Navier-Stokes equations.
